# ðŸš˜ Car Price Prediction Using Linear & Lasso Regression
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict car selling prices using regression-based algorithms.
The notebook implements Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to estimate prices based on key vehicle attributes such as fuel type, transmission, and year of manufacture.

The workflow demonstrates a complete supervised learning pipeline: data cleaning â†’ feature encoding â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ comparison.
It provides valuable insights into how linear models can capture market trends in car pricing.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset car data.csv contains real-world data of cars listed for resale.
Each record includes vehicle specifications and their corresponding selling prices. Link:

### Key Features:

Car_Name â€“ Name of the car model

Year â€“ Year of manufacture

Selling_Price â€“ Price at which the car was sold (Target)

Present_Price â€“ Current ex-showroom price

Driven_kms â€“ Total kilometers driven

Fuel_Type â€“ Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)

Seller_Type â€“ Type of seller (Dealer, Individual)

Transmission â€“ Gear type (Manual, Automatic)

Owner â€“ Number of previous owners

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Handled Missing Values: Checked for null entries (none found).

Categorical Encoding:

Fuel_Type: Petrol â†’ 0, Diesel â†’ 1, CNG â†’ 2

Seller_Type: Dealer â†’ 0, Individual â†’ 1

Transmission: Manual â†’ 0, Automatic â†’ 1

Feature Selection:

Dropped Car_Name (non-numeric, non-predictive).

Split dataset into features (X) and target (Y = Selling_Price).

Train-Test Split: 90% training, 10% testing with random state = 2.

## ðŸ¤– Model Implementation
### ðŸ”¹ Linear Regression

Objective: Capture the linear relationship between features and car price.

Model: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression

Training: Fit on X_train and Y_train

Evaluation Metrics:

RÂ² Score on training and test data

Visualization of predicted vs actual prices

### ðŸ”¹ Lasso Regression

Objective: Regularized version of Linear Regression to prevent overfitting by applying L1 penalty.

Model: sklearn.linear_model.Lasso

Comparison: Both modelsâ€™ performances were evaluated to identify which provides better generalization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation
After training both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models, their performance was tested using the RÂ² score.

For the Linear Regression model, the RÂ² score on the training data was around 0.96, and on the test data, it was around 0.84. This means the model fits the training data very well but may slightly overfit.

For the Lasso Regression model, the RÂ² score on the training data was around 0.84, and on the test data, it was around 0.82. The accuracy is slightly lower than Linear Regression, but the model is more stable and generalizes better.

Both models accurately predict car prices, with Linear Regression performing slightly better in-sample, and Lasso offering better control of overfitting.

Visual Analysis:

Predicted vs Actual price plots show close alignment, validating the modelsâ€™ performance.

Distribution of residuals indicates that errors are approximately normally distributed.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

Include additional features like car brand reputation, location, or condition score.

Compare with advanced models (Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard for user-input-based predictions.

Apply hyperparameter tuning for Lasso to optimize the alpha value.
